        <h1>Old-Fashioned Pancakes</h1>
        <p>I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. 
            Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>

        <h2>Pancake Ingredients</h2>
            <p>You likely already have everything you need to make this pancake recipe. 
                If not, here's what to add to your grocery list:</p>
            
            <h4>Flour</h4>
            <p>This homemade pancake recipe starts with all-purpose flour.</p>
            
            <h4>Baking powder</h4>
            <p>Baking powder, a leavener, is the secret to fluffy pancakes.</p>
            
            <h4>Sugar</h4>
            <p>Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</p>
            
            <h4>Salt</h4>
            <p>A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</p>
            
            <h4>Milk and butter</h4>
            <p>Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</p>
        
            <h4>Egg</h4>
            <p>A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. 
                Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix until smooth.</p>

            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, 
                using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. 
                Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</p>
