        <h2>Crêpes Ingredients</h2>
            <p>Crêpes are easy to make with basic ingredients you likely already have on hand:</p>
            
            <h4>Flour</h4>
            <p>These basic French crêpes start with a cup of all-purpose flour.</p>
            
            <h4>Eggs</h4>
            <p>Eggs act as a binder, which means they help hold the batter together.</p>
            
            <h4>Milk</h4>
            <p>Milk adds moisture and keeps the crêpes tender.</p>
            
            <h4>Water</h4>
            <p>Water helps thin the batter.</p>
            
            <h4>Salt</h4>
            <p>A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor.</p>
        
            <h4>Butter</h4>
            <p>Butter lends richness and moisture to the crêpes.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>½ cup milk</li>
                <li>½ cup water</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p>Whisk flour and eggs together in a large mixing bowl; 
                 gradually add in milk and water, stirring to combine. Add salt and melted butter; beat until smooth.</p>

            <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. 
                Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crêpe. 
                Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</p>
            
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>Cook until the top of the crêpe is no longer wet and the bottom has turned light brown, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                Run a spatula around the edge of the skillet to loosen the crêpe; flip and cook until the other side has turned light brown, about 1 minute more. Serve hot.</p>
